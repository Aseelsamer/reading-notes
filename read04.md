CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element and to that element’s children.

### Properties for the parent :
1-display(grid,inline-grid).

2-grid-template-columns (track-size,line-name)
  grid-template-rows

3-grid template areas(grid-area-name,.,none)

4-grid-template(none,grid-template-rows,grid-template-column)

5-column-gap
  row-gap
  grid-column-gap
  grid-row-gap

6-gap
  grid-gap

7-justify-items

8-align-items

9-place-items

10-justify-content

11-align-content


### Properties for the Children
Note:
float, display: inline-block, display: table-cell, vertical-align and column-* properties have no effect on a grid item.
1-grid-column-start
  grid-column-end
  grid-row-start
  grid-row-end

2-grid-column,grid-row

3-grid-area

4-justify-self

5-align-self

6-place-self

## Responsive design with CSS Grid

Quick hints can be used in CSS:

-The repeat() function takes two arguments, the first will define the number of column tracks and the second, what width the tracks should be.

object-fit: cover;  -->will stop the image from stretching, but it will cause cropping to happen.

-grid-gap property. This defines the size of the space between the columns and the rows.

-To create similar gaps between elements with flexbox we currently have to use a combination of margin and the justify-content properties, however column-gap and row-gap

-This image gallery layout uses features of CSS grid to create different sizes of grid cells. I’ve used the span value on grid-column and grid-row to make individual cells stretch over two or more slots in the track.

-column-count: 2; ,  column-gap: 20px; -- >This styles will create two columns with a gap between them of 20px.
