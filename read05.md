## Node.js 
is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform.

### Heroku
 is a cloud platform as a service. It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer. (to  turn your local server into a world wide server you have to use Heroku cloud application platform.)
Heroku will generate a random name for your application.
Every Heroku app starts with no branches and no code. So, the first time we deploy our project, we need to specify a remote branch to push to.
